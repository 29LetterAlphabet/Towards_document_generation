generate.sh will generate reports from any pcap files in the folder. Alter the dates in the reporting generation (report1.py) to match the values created by the splitter.py program. Everything else should hold naming conventions to ensure that the report generates. Feel free to tinker with the code or tear it apart and do what you want with it.

God speed.

Also you will need a few libraries
dpkt
pandas
matplotlib
are the main ones
